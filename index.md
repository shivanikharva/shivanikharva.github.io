Hi! My name is Shivani Kharva and I recently graduated as a **Statistics and Data Science major at UCSB**. I was also a part of the **Honor's Program** and completed the undergraduate portion of UCSB's **Technology Management Program**. As I continue learning, I would like to learn more about how business and data interact as well as how to communicating data to individuals without a technical background. I love math, baking, reading, art, playing video games, and going on nature walks.  

Most recently, I was a **Cybersecurity, Risk, and Regulatory - Data Risk and Privacy Intern** at **PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP** during Summer 2023. I extensively engaged in client work where traced the lineage of my client's data elements through Snowflake and Alation using their SQL code and provided documents. This internship was a major stepping stone in my technical career and I learned a great deal about data, governance, and data lineage.

During my 3 years at UCSB, my main extracurricular was the **Data Science Club**. While I was a student, I acted as the **Chair of Directors**, which allowed me to work with executive board in hosting major club events (Fall Career Fair, Project Showcase, etc.) while also acting as a communication point between the executive board and the rest of the directors. Also, I helped maintain the club website, which can be found [here](https://www.datascienceucsb.org/).   

Furthermore, in Summer 2022, I took on a role as a **Solutions Engineer Intern** at **HG Insights**. My daily tasks would revolve around completing Data-as-a-Service requests using Microsoft SQL Server and communicating with Customer Succuess Managers to ensure that customer deliverables were up to company standard. I also took part in the transition from HG Insight's product, Platform v1.0, to their new Platform v2.0 by communicating discrepancies between the two user interfaces.

I hope you enjoy exploring this website and getting to know me a little more!
