- Tested and developed regression-based machine learning models (random forest, k nearest neighbors, etc.) in an attempt to accurately predict the capture rate of a Pokemon    

## Pyspark  
[Predicting Voter Turnout in Arizona and Utah](https://github.com/shivanikharva/voter-turnout/blob/main/FinalProject.ipynb)  
- Built and tested regression-based machine learning models (linear regression, random forest, gradient boosted tree) to accurately predict presidential election voter turnout percentages by county in Arizona and Utah  

## Python    
[Vaccine Efficacy in California](https://deepnote.com/workspace/pstat-100-course-project-06a57dc5-3fdf-4146-a1bb-ef02b8091492/project/PSTAT-100-Final-Report-03b916f0-6b5e-4d99-9ed1-a0b7d32e15e6/%2Fproject-final-report.ipynb)  
- In a group, explored the effectiveness of vaccination status on Covid-19 cases and deaths in California using Python with an emphasis on the most recent booster shot advancement  

[Call of Duty Skills](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wc2q_D-s0L3Xm7TEeR0IRsGRWsvcnyK3?usp=sharing)  
- Analyzed the effect of experience with playing Call of Duty (games played, time played) on the success of players (kill/death ratio, total wins) using Python and a Kaggle dataset  

## C++  
[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/shivanikharva/C-Plus-Plus-Code/blob/main/tictactoe)  
- A tic-tac-toe simulation built in Microsoft Visual Studio C++ that allows the user to play against a manual competitor (duo) or an artificial intelligence competitor (solo)
